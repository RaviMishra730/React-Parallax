      <h3>What is AI?</h3>
      <p>
        Artificial intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence
        processes by machines, especially computer systems. Specific
        applications of AI include expert systems, natural language processing,
        speech recognition and machine vision. In the simplest terms, AI which
        stands for artificial intelligence refers to systems or machines that
        mimic human intelligence to perform tasks and can iteratively improve
        themselves based on the information they collect. AI manifests in a
        number of forms. A few examples are: Chatbots use AI to understand
        customer problems faster and provide more efficient answers Intelligent
        assistants use AI to parse critical information from large free-text
        datasets to improve scheduling Recommendation engines can provide
        automated recommendations for TV shows based on users’ viewing habits AI
        is much more about the process and the capability for superpowered
        thinking and data analysis than it is about any particular format or
        function. Although AI brings up images of high-functioning, human-like
        robots taking over the world, AI isn’t intended to replace humans. It’s
        intended to significantly enhance human capabilities and contributions.
        That makes it a very valuable business asset.
